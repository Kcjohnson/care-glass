/*
Build a squared gene x subject matrix for heatmap plotting
1. Get selected tumor pairs as described elsewhere (`selected_tumor_pairs`)
	- reduce this list to a list of aliquots, combining (a) and (b) into a single column (`selected_aliquots`). This list is only used for coverage
2. Select a list of genes and specific variants
	- Take genes deemed significant using the dNdS-CV method
	- Manually adding a genes that are not significant by dNdS but are known glioma genes (handpicked from Anzhela's list)
	- Filter the list of variants by subsetting hotspot variants only for those genes where they are known
3. Take the cartesian product between the genes and aliquots table, generating a table with (genes x aliquots) numbers of rows (`selected_genes_samples`)
	- Get coverage statistics from all these loci across all aliquots and compute median for each gene and aliquot (`gene_sample_coverage`)
	- Use the tumor pairs list from step 1 to align tumor pairs to genes and coverage statistics for sample (a) and (b) from each pair (`gene_pair_coverage`)
4. Take variants from each tumor_barcode, subsetting selected tumor pairs from step 1 and by variants from step 2 (`variants_by_case_and_gene`)
	- For each pair, there exists an optimal first tumor (a) and subsequent tumor sample (b)
	- Aggregate over variants by case_barcode and gene_symbol, selecting only the top variant for each subject/gene combination
	- Restrict to events with coverage >= 5 in both (a) and (b)
	- Variants for each tumor pair/gene combination are ordered according to variant_classification_priority (see new table analysis.variant_classifications) and whether or not the mutation was called in a/b and finally based on read_depth
	- Manually calling all variants based on a 0.05 VAF threshold, since we already applied stringent filtering prior to this step (eg. only variants with a mutect call in either (a) or (b) are included in the data at this point)
5. Right join the limited list of variants from step 4 with the extensive coverage statistics from step 3, generating a squared table with all genes and all subjects (`squared_variants`)
6. Perform a subject level call of whether the variant was called in sample A only (initial only), B only (recurrence only), or both (shared), or in neither mark as wild-type.
	- If there is not enough coverage in either A or B, mark the gene/subject combination as NULL to indicate insufficient coverage.
